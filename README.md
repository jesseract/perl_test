# Perl/Database

These were projects done as a code test for a job interview. 

There are two separate small projects to accomplish with this assignment.

Project one : HTML / JavaScript

You will design a small web application GUI, using HTML and JavaScript that does the following:

- Write a function which processes the a data structure to insert an HTML table into a web page.

Project two : Perl / Database

You will write a Perl script to output the contents of a table in a database.

- Create a database containing one table with data.  (You must have at lease three columns.)  (You can use the data from project one.)
- Using the DBI Perl module, write a perl script that connects to a database.
- The script selects the contents of the table you created.
- Finally the script prints out the contents of the table.

We are looking for a syntactically correct perl script.
